# devils_debugging_rbjs

This repo will follow the Udacity course on Software Debugging (https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/cs25) and offer its code-based exercises in Ruby. The goal is to make this amazing course more accessible so that aspiring rubyists can practice a core problem-solving skill not taught by most bootcamps or tutorials.

The title is inspired by Steve McConnell's Devil's Guide to Debugging which felt, too keenly, like a Lacanian mirror moment.
