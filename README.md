# devils_debugging_rbjs

This repo will follow the Udacity course on Software Debugging (https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/cs25) and offer its code-based exercises in Ruby and Javscript. 

The title is inspired by Steve McConnell's Devil's Guide to Debugging which felt, too kneenly, like a Lacanian mirror moment.

The goal is to help self-taught people whose first language is often Rb or JS (or Py but that's covered by the course) an accessible way to practice a core problem-solving  skill not taught by most bootcamps or tutorials..
